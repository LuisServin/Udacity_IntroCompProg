when would you want to create a remote repository rather than 
keeping all your work local?

I think it's a great to have a backup or to share my projects 
with other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
having Git automatically stayup to date with your remote 
repository?

Because i could manage only the files that i need to make my 
work instead of having a incredible number of files with
unknown content
