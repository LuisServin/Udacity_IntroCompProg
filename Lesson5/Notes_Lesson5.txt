In this Lesson the main idea is try to understand is an 
algorithm is fass enought and how can we improve our 
lookup algorithm with the use of hash tables

Functions:

ord(<one-letter-string>) -> Number
	
	Takes an string an produces a number based on that
	string

chr(<Number>) -> <one-letter-string>
	
	Takes a number an produces a one letter string 
	based on that number

Both are inverse functions
